## 60 participants, 17 LoRaWAN projects

The event was driven by the **The Things Network Zürich community** in cooperation with the **City of Zürich** with the goal of bringing together the hacker/maker community that has been deeply involved in the local deployment of The Things Network and the city administration with the idea of exploring new solutions for the city's problems.

The event attracted around 60 participants from different disciplines that got together on Friday 27th to kick-off an intense week of hacking leading up to a 2-day hackathon on Friday 3rd-Saturday 4th.

During these two days, we had [Wienke Giezeman](https://twitter.com/wienke) as a special guest on-site, as well as the presence numerous journalists that were covering the event, which culminated with the presentations of a total of 17 projects.
