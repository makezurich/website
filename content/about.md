#### But I'm really a complete beginner. Can I still come?

Of course! The greater the diversity of backgrounds and skills,
the more awesome the outcome!

#### How much does it cost?

Nothing. It is totally free.

#### What is civic tech?

Technology enables citizen engagement. This means citizens building or maintaining some of the infrastructure for their city, instead of only governments and companies being in charge of everything. 
Groups to share knowledge and support each other in projects and civic tech initiatives exist in most cities of the world, among them, here in Zurich. We are part of a community that has already deployed a LoRaWAN network in the city, and indeed, throughout Switzerland.

#### What is LoRaWAN?

Long Range Wide Area Networks ([LoRaWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa#LoRaWAN) are a wireless technology, much like your regular WiFi, but it is ideal for IoT and battery powered sensors because it has a huge range and low energy requirements. 

Head over to [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) website, and check out
the *LEARN* section and the forum.
