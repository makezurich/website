Make Zurich is a community event around civic tech and in particular, the [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) community. It brings together the maker community and the city administration to devise creative solutions to our city's problems.

On June 10th 2023, at the closing session of this year's edition, 26 participants in 15 different teams presented their ideas, prototypes and creative solutions for the 5 challenges posed by the city administration.

You can relive the presentations right below, and explore each of the projects and respective documentation on the links below.
