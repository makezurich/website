## 2. Start/Join project

We use [now.makezurich.ch](https://now.makezurich.ch/) - an open source tool developed by our own team - for teambuilding and pulling together the hackathon projects.

1. To sign in, use your existing [TTN-CH Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ttn-ch/shared_invite/zt-8tw3zlol-KDaiqrKZ8ZdMbqWoC7EVXQ) account, or create a dribdat account.
2. [See all challenges and existing projects](https://now.makezurich.ch/event/5)
3. Then either [Start a project](https://now.makezurich.ch/project/event/5/project/new)
4. ...or [join an existing team](https://now.makezurich.ch/event/5)

If you need more details, here's a [quick guide to Dribdat](../dribdat)

## 3. Get hacking

You are welcome to use any collaboration tool, with emphasis on all platforms that can be freely shared with all team members. The central community Slack is available, everyone will be invited so you can easily have a chat with your team members:

* Announcements and team building in the [#makezurich](https://app.slack.com/client/T0CMJ6ESH/C3XSZ7NTF/thread/CB94UMQMC-1561794678.000600) channel
* Need other support at the event? [#makezurich-help](https://app.slack.com/client/T0CMJ6ESH/C01CRBDCTE2/thread/CB94UMQMC-1561794678.000600)

## 4. Hack and Make!

### Around the city

Zurich has a very large free, open and crowd-sourced LoRaWAN network!

If you don't have coverage where you live, let us know, the nicest thing is that extending coverage is very easy!

#### LoRaWAN & The Things Network

Are you new to LoRaWAN? The best way to get started with it and The Things Network is the **LEARN** section of the website: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/

Additional resources:

* [Documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/)
* [LoRa crash course by Thomas Telkamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3dGLqZrjIQ)
* [The Things Network: Basics](https://speakerdeck.com/gonzalocasas/the-things-network-basic-presentation)

## 5. Present your idea

On Saturday 10th, at the end of the second hackday, teams will present their projects. Make sure you documented yours on Dribdat and ideally also published code and assets you created with open source licenses!
